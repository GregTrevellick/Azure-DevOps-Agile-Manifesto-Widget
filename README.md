# Privacy Policy For Agile Manifesto Widget

## TLDR 
This extension does not collect any data about you or your organisation. Period.

## Legal

The Agile Manifesto Widget (hereinafter referred to as the "Widget") operates from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GregTrevellick.AgileManifestoDashboardWidget) website (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my Widget.

The Widget does **NOT** collect or use **ANY** information, personal or otherwise, whatsoever.

This includes but is not limited to:
- Cookie data
- Organization data
- Personal data 
- Tracking data 
- Usage data

## Microsoft Privacy Policy 
Of course, as Microsoft host all extensions for their tooling, the [Microsoft privacy policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement) additionally applies to their website but does not in anyway negate or dilute the privacy policy of the Service (my widget in other words). Please note that the [link](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement) above is for Microsoft's general privacy policy and is not specific to the Visual Studio Marketplace.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy
Whilst in theory I could update my Privacy Policy from time to time, I won't.
