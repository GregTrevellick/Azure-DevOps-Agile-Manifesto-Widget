The Agile Manifesto Widget (hereinafter referred to as the "Widget") operates from the [Azure DevOps Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GregTrevellick.AgileManifestoDashboardWidget) website (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use my Widget.

This includes but is not limited to:

## Microsoft Privacy Policy 

Since Microsoft host all extensions for their tooling, the [Microsoft privacy policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement) additionally applies to their website. This does not in anyway negate or dilute the privacy policy of the Widget. Please note that the [link](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-gb/privacystatement) above is for Microsoft's general privacy policy and is not specific to the Visual Studio Marketplace.
